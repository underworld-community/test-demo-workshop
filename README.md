____
Welcome! This is a template git repository for creating REPRODUCIBLE Underworld code based projects.

REPRODUCIBLE because this project:
1. Is stored in a git repository.
2. Uses a Dockerfile to recreate the exact project environment.

The 2 features above enable the project to take advantage of software engineering and open source principles, such as:
_version control_, _reproducible environments_, _collaboration_ (Pull Requests, Binderhub), _continuous integration_. 

(See https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/, for a general introduction to these principle. N.B. it is data-science focussed)  

*Welcome to the future of Underworld community projects.*

Feel free to get rid of the above information and add your own.
